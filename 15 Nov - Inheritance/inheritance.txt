IS-A and Has-A

IS-A --> Relationship Inheritance -->parent class and child class

--> Dog is a Animal(features, behaviour)

--> Car is a Vehicle(features, behaviour)


Has-A --> Class and Object relationship

--> Ram(object) has a Loan(class)--> AutoLoan, Edu, Personal, Home, etc

--> Aman(object) has a Account(class)

--> if need to use all features of class or most of the freatures of class--> better to do inheritance --> is-a

--> if need to use only one or two or limited features of class--> better to do create object of that class--> has-a


--> Java provides 3 types inheritance:
--> single inheritance or single level inheritance
--> multi-level inheritance
--> hierarical inheritance
